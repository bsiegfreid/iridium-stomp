Title: Stabilize public API & docs

Body:
What: Review and stabilize the public API surface (types/functions) and add comprehensive documentation.

Why: Consumers need clear docs and stable API to adopt the crate.

Acceptance criteria:
- Doc comments for main types and functions (Connection, Frame, codec API) exist.
- README shows a minimal example that compiles (copy-pastable).
- rustdoc generates without warnings.

Estimate: 1-2 days
